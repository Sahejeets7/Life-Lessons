Set small, achievable goals
Kaizen emphasises on the importance of setting realistic goals. Break those larger tasks into smaller steps. By focusing on smaller goals, you can reduce the overwhelming feeling of laziness.

Embrace the one-minute principle
This principle is a powerful technique. You commit to spending just one minute on the task you've been avoiding. Often, the hardest part is how you get started. Once you begin, you are bound to find it easier to continue and complete the task.

Create a routine
Establish a consistent routine as that can help overcome laziness. Set aside specific times for work, exercise, relaxation, and other activities. Having a structured schedule will help instill discipline and reduce the tendency to procrastinate.

The Pomodoro technique
The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method that can boost productivity. Break your tasks into 25-minute intervals, called "pomodoros," followed by a short break. This technique helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.

Use visual cues
Surround yourself with visual reminders of your goals and the tasks at hand. This can include sticky notes, vision boards, or other visual aids that serve as constant prompts to stay motivated and productive.

Practice self-discipline
Laziness often stems from a need for more self-discipline. Train yourself to resist the urge to give in to procrastination and distractions. Set deadlines, prioritize tasks, and practice mindfulness to stay focused and disciplined.

Find accountability partners
Seek support from those who share similar goals or have a strong work ethic. Engage in regular check-ins, share progress, and hold each other accountable. Working with such individuals can inspire and encourage in combating laziness.

Celebrate progress
Acknowledge and reward yourself for the progress you make along the way. Celebrating small achievements reinforces positive behaviour and motivates you to continue overcoming laziness.

Cultivate a growth mindset
Embrace the idea that personal development is a lifelong journey. Adopt a growth mindset that focuses on learning and improvement. Rather than being discouraged by setbacks, view them as opportunities to learn and grow.
